# Modal Window Project

Welcome to the Modal Window Project! This project demonstrates a simple implementation of modal windows using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

Modal windows are a common user interface pattern used to display content or messages in a pop-up overlay, while dimming the background to draw focus to the modal content. In this project, we've created a customizable modal window that can be triggered by clicking on buttons. Each button corresponds to a different modal window, displaying unique content when clicked.

## Features

- Clicking on the "Show modal" buttons triggers the corresponding modal window to appear.
- Each modal window contains unique content, including headings and paragraphs.
- Users can close the modal windows by clicking on the close button or anywhere outside the modal.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the modal windows and buttons.
- CSS: Styling language for designing the appearance and layout of the modal windows and buttons.
- JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity to the modal windows, including opening and closing functionality.
